        <li><p>When turning right or left, the driver gives way to pedestrians crossing the carriageway in his direction of motion, which he turns to, to cyclists crossing it on a bicycle lane, and route vehicles.</p> </li>


<li><p>When turning to the left or turning at the permissive signal of the traffic light, the driver of a trackless vehicle gives way to vehicles moving from the opposite direction directly or to the right, including entering the intersection.</p></li>

<li><p>A driver who enters the intersection at a permissive traffic light leaves in the intended direction regardless of the traffic lights at the exit from the intersection.</p>

<li><p>At the intersection where traffic is regulated by a traffic light with an additional section, the driver, who is on the lane with which the turn is made, continues to move in the direction indicated by the included arrow.</p></li>
