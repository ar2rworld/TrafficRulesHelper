        <li><p>When driving on a road from a secondary road, the driver gives way to vehicles and pedestrians moving along it, and at the exit from the road - to pedestrians and cyclists, the path of which he crosses. </p> </li>


<li><p> When approaching a stopping or parking place, the driver gives way to pedestrians moving along the edge of the carriageway or the roadside, drivers of bicycles, mopeds, horse-drawn carts, drivers of riding and pack animals.</p></li>

<li><p>When changing the line the driver gives way to vehicles moving along the way without changing the direction of movement. When simultaneously moving vehicles moving along the way, the driver gives way to the vehicle on the right. Changing the line is not allowed, as a result of which a dangerous distance is created between moving vehicles.</p>

<li><p> When turning left or turning outside the intersection, the driver of a trackless vehicle gives way to oncoming vehicles.</p></li>
<li><p>In cases where the trajectories of vehicles intersect, and the sequence of travel is not determined by these Rules, the driver gives way to which the vehicle approaches on the right.</p></li>
<li><p>Reversing is prohibited at intersections and in places where turning is prohibited according to paragraph 12 of this section.</p></li>
